          <h3>Let Me Introduce Myself.</h3>
          <p>
            Greetings! I'm Ajeena Sunny, an aspiring web developer currently
            immersed in the dynamic realm of web development at Conestoga
            College. With a fervent enthusiasm for coding, I find joy in
            unraveling the intricacies of web technologies to create seamless
            and visually appealing digital experiences. My academic journey at
            Conestoga College not only equips me with a strong foundation in web
            development principles but also fosters a creative mindset to tackle
            real-world challenges. Proficient in languages such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and beyond, I am constantly exploring innovative
            frameworks and libraries to enhance my skill set. Beyond the
            classroom, my hands-on projects range from responsive web designs to
            interactive user interfaces. Whether it's optimizing website
            performance, implementing user authentication, or experimenting with
            the latest front-end frameworks, I thrive on turning concepts into
            tangible, user-friendly solutions.
